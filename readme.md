## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Implementation

To create a holistic user profile that integrates structured and unstructured data for better retrieval, reasoning, and risk analysis in mental health discharge planning, a knowledge graph offers a powerful solution. This approach enables agents in the multi-agent AI system to retrieve relevant data efficiently, reason about connections (e.g., symptoms to diagnoses), and identify flags or risks comprehensively.
The graph serves as a centralized data store, enabling agents to query specific subgraphs efficiently:

### Technical Implementation
```
- Backend: Neo4j Graph Database
- Schema: Extended property graph model
- Query Language: Cypher for CRUD operations
- API: GraphQL for agent interactions
- Versioning: Temporal modeling with datetime stamps
- Storage: Multi-model (graph + document) for efficient querying
```

### Data Structure
- **Node Properties**: Metadata including timestamp, source, confidence, version
- **Edge Properties**: Relationship strength, evidence level, provenance
- **Indexing**: B-tree indexes on frequently queried node properties
- **Constraints**: Uniqueness constraints on node identifiers
- **Query Caching**: LRU cache for frequent pattern queries
- **Access Control**: Role-based access for different agent operations

### Conflict Resolution Framework
- Rule-based conflict detector identifies contradictory assertions
- Bayesian confidence scoring for contradictory information
- Source reliability weighting matrix (clinician > structured EHR > patient report)
- Temporal resolution with exponential decay on information relevance
- Explicit uncertainty representation using probability distributions

## Final Notes:

This multi-agent system leverages a sophisticated dynamic knowledge graph and specialized agents to assist clinicians in mental health discharge planning. Through careful technical integration and alignment between agents, it provides a comprehensive solution for predicting relapse risk, generating personalized care plans, and summarizing key clinical insights. The system's architecture emphasizes evidence-based reasoning, explicit uncertainty handling, and transparent decision processes to support clinician trust while improving patient outcomes.


With mental health, its tough as a tremendous number of factors affect a patient.
There can be various sources of cause and triggers for relapse.
A person who shows signs of high recovery in a controlled environment, could fail when facing the past triggers, or when dealing with real world unpredictable environment. 


#### AgentCause
	Agent is used for determining, what can be causing the recent changes, or recent symptoms, that the patient is seeing.
	This agent is basically assesing all the data from patient metrics, heart rate, menstrual cycle, hormonal  changes, 
	This is basically assesing the physical cause that may be causing certain symptoms. 

#### PastHistory 
	Asses previous diagnosis, and what all the patient has experienced medically, to asses what works and especially WHAT DOENST WORK. 
	But this data is available, how do I make it useful here?

#### On Risk Prediction
   To evaluate the Risk Prediction Agent and other agents in the mental health discharge planning system, we create a high-quality dataset with clinician-generated profiles as ground truth, split into controlled (low variability) and high-variability cases. For the Risk Prediction Agent, clinicians provide risk assessments (e.g., “70% relapse risk, factors: isolation, non-adherence”), while for high-variability cases, they also note missing data needs (e.g., “requires trauma history”). An LLM compares agent outputs to these profiles, measuring precision (risks matching clinician’s), recall (clinician risks captured), and F1-score, with penalties for missed critical risks (e.g., -5% per miss). Extra risks identified by the agent are logged as potential strengths for later validation.
   In controlled cases, we test baseline accuracy (e.g., “Agent: 60% risk, isolation” vs. “Clinician: 65%, isolation”), refining the agent’s logic (e.g., emphasize event nodes) if misses occur. For high-variability cases, the agent suggests data gaps (e.g., “request substance use history”), scored against clinician annotations for accuracy. This dual approach—refining core performance on simple cases and enhancing adaptability on complex ones—extends to other agents (e.g., Diagnostic Reasoning Agent: diagnosis match; Care Plan Agent: intervention overlap). Iterative testing and feedback ensure agents align with clinician expertise, improving reliability across scenarios while maintaining coherence and actionability.
